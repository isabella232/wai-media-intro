Captions and audio descriptions make online media accessible to people who have disabilities. This tutorial will demonstrate how to add captions and audio descriptions to online media.  Other accessibility techniques, such as transcripts and foreign-language subtitles, are included in the discussion.  Here are brief definitions of these media-accessibility approaches.
{:#cc+ad_purpose}

-   **Audio descriptions**: An extra track of narration that conveys
    information about important on-screen elements, such as body
    language, changes in scenery and context, on-screen charts and
    diagrams, etc.
-   **Captions**: A text version of the program dialogue and narration,
    or other spoken words, fully synchronized with the program audio and
    displayed within the media player. Captions also include text
    identifying non-speech information, such as music and sound effects.
-   **Subtitles**: A text version of a program's audio track, fully
    synchronized with the audio and translated into another language.
-   **Transcript**: A text version of a program's audio track,
    containing narration or dialog plus non-speech information such as
    speaker-identification cues. Transcripts can be static documents or
    they can be interactive: e.g., a transcript can be synchronized so
    that words are highlighted automatically as they are spoken, or
    words can selected by the user in order to move to that spot in the
    video.

## Quality considerations

The quality of the captions and descriptions that are delivered to users
is of high importance. In the same way that low-quality, incomplete
audio is unacceptable to hearing viewers, captions that do not
accurately reflect the audio, or contain spelling and grammatical
errors, are unacceptable to deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. Similarly,
audio descriptions that provide misleading or inaccurate information, or
which provide unnecessary detail (e.g., by giving away clues or
answers), are of no use to viewers who are blind or visually impaired.

## Why is this important?

Besides providing crucial communication access for viewers who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind or visually impaired, captions and descriptions have benefits beyond their original target
audiences:

-   Both captions and descriptions can be used to help students and adults with cognitive disabilities engage more directly with media, helping to focus attention or to provide comprehension support.
-   Captions are useful when teaching children and adults how to read,
    or to help people learn a foreign language.
-   Captions can be used by all people: for example, in noisy
    environments such as a bar or an airport lounge, or in any place
    where it would be inappropriate to turn up the volume.
-   Search engines can use captions as a way to locate information in a
    video or audio presentation.
-   Audio descriptions can be used to reinforce complex visual concepts,
    especially for children or adults with learning disabilities.

In some cases, captions and descriptions may be the only means by which users can access any information at all from video or audio clips.

For a quick overview on determining whether or not captions and audio
descriptions are necessary, see the [caption/description decision
tree](decision-tree.html).
